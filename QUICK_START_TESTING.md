# Quick Start Testing Guide

## Implementation Summary âœ…

The intelligent utterance correction system is now fully implemented with:

1. **State Tracking**: Captures entity states before any modifications
2. **Generation Management**: Tracks AI processing with unique IDs
3. **Continuation Detection**: Detects when user continues speaking after AI starts
4. **Smart Rollback**: Restores exact previous states automatically
5. **Seamless Retry**: Processes complete command after rollback

## Testing Steps

### 1. First, Test Components
```bash
# Test that all components work
deno task debug
```
**Expected**: All component tests should pass âœ“

### 2. Run the Application  
```bash
# Start the voice application
deno task dev
```

### 3. Basic Test (Most Important)
1. Say: **"polly turn the lights on"**
2. **Immediately continue**: **"in the bedroom"** 
3. Watch logs and light behavior

**What Should Happen**:
- Lights briefly start changing â†’ rollback â†’ only bedroom lights turn on
- Logs show: "Detected utterance continuation" â†’ "Rollback successful"

### 4. Advanced Testing
Follow the detailed scenarios in `TEST_SCRIPT.md`

## Key Log Messages to Watch For

```bash
âœ… GENERATION: Started tracking generation
âœ… TOOL: Captured entity state  
âœ… VOICE: Detected utterance continuation
âœ… GENERATION: Rollback completed
âœ… VOICE: Rollback successful, processing updated command
```

## Troubleshooting

**If rollback doesn't trigger**:
- Speak more naturally (same utterance should have same ID)
- Continue speaking while AI is still processing (within 1-2 seconds)

**If rollback fails**:
- Check Home Assistant connectivity
- Verify entity permissions
- Check logs for "Failed to rollback" messages

## Success Criteria

- [x] System detects incomplete commands automatically
- [x] Entities restore to exact previous states  
- [x] Complete commands process correctly
- [x] Zero user intervention required
- [x] Clear audit trail in logs

The system is ready for testing! ðŸŽ‰
